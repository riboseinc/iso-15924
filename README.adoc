== Release process

=== Versioning

The package is versioned as follows:

[source]
--
1.20200101.0
| |        |
| |        ^ patch version
| ^ timestamp
^ major version
--

Timestamp reflects the date of latest item in the registry.

=== Rebuild the registry

[source]
--
yarn compile; yarn build-json; yarn dist
--

=== Ensure correct version

This will create files under dist/, including package.json with version
that reflects the timestamp of the latest item in the registry.

Major and patch components of the version are currently fixed as 1 and 0
respectively. If a different major or patch package version should be published,
manually edit dist/package.json to increment the number.

=== Publishing to NPM

Publish as per usual. This is not done automatically.
